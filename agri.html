                Proﬁtability in businesses like cattle rearing, poultry and goat farming, horse breeding largely depends upon the health of the livestock. The feed given to the livestock is one of the key factors instrumental in building their health. The feed has to be nutritious enough to fulﬁll the animal’s nutritional requirements and to build an immunity of the livestock so that it yields a sustainable production or performance across its productive age.
